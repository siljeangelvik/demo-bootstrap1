#Course Assignment:
##Goal
To apply knowledge of Bootstrap and SASS to build a responsive front end for a social media application.

##Brief
**You are tasked with creating 3 pages in HTML using Bootstrap and SASS:**

* Homepage
* Profile page
* Login page


** The **Homepage** should have a feed of posts from the user’s contacts, a search bar, and a form to create a new post.  
** The **profile page** should have a profile image, details about the user, a list of the user’s contacts, their posts and a form to post to their wall.  
** The **login page** should have a form to login to the application.

_You will only be working on the visuals for this project at this stage, forms do not need to submit data, for example._
